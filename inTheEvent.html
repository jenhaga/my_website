      <h4 id="intro">Just because life is unpredictable ...</h4>
      <h4 class="instructions">If I am injured to the point that I can't make decisions for myself, please know this:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I am not so attached to life that I would prioritize longevity over quality so ...</li>
          <li>If machines are required to keep me alive long term, I do not wish to live.</li>
          <li>If I cannot communicate with others in a meaningful way such that I can maintain relationships, I do not wish to live.</li>
          <li>If my continued existence will be a burden to others, I do not wish to live.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4 class="instructions">If I die unexpectedly, here are my wishes:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If my loved ones would like some sort of funeralish gathering 1) please hold it at a secular venue or a UU church, 2) please make use of my favorite music from my ipod (code to unlock is the month and year Bullet was adopted), 3) please allow family and friends to say a few words if they so desire.</li>
          <li>If food is served when people are gathering to remember me, see to it that it's vegan.</li>
          <li>Please dispose of my body in the most environmentally friendly way possible. I do not want a casket/coffin. If possible, send the remains of my cats with me; they're on the bookshelf.</li>
          <li>If Bullet is still alive, he needs to be cared for by someone who will love him and pay close attention to him. He has special needs. If he must travel by air, he must be a carry-on. He cannot ride with the baggage.</li>
          <li>You can honor my memory by keeping in mind the ideas that were important to me and living them to the extent possible i.e. compassion and respect for non-human animals (including the ones you want to eat) and for the natural world we all must share.</li>
        </ul>
